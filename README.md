ThisIsMyJam Graphs
===================

Network/Grash based analysis of the ThisIsMyJam data dump.
This repository contains the code I used to generate all the data and plots for the analysis.
For serveral tasks there may be multiple implementations which differ in their beauty/efficency ratio.
Some of these are used to generate the data in the end, other just reside here to show the basic idea.

cojam Graphs
------------

A cojam graph is constructed by connecting users that jam'ed the same tracks/artists.
We can use this to analyse how similar people are jam'ing tunes and the friendship network would look like if everyone would only be friends with people with same interests.

The cojam graph is an undirected graph where users are represented as vertices and an edge exists between two users if they have jam'ed the same track or artist.
The edge weight is the number of artists/tracks being jam'ed by both.

The cojam graph based only on artists can be generated by running `cojam-graph3-runner.sh`.
This will result in an about 27G large `cojam3.graphml`.
